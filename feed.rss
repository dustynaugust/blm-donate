ACCE is dedicated to raising the voices of everyday Californians, neighborhood by neighborhood, to fight for the policies and programs we need to improve our communities and create a brighter future.</p><p>Change from the bottom up: We take seriously our commitment to ground-up organizing to build a strong people’s movement that can create transformative community change. Our local neighborhood chapters and issue committees, led by ACCE Action member leaders, meet regularly to strategize and plan campaigns. Central to this work is the belief that there’s power in numbers and in collective action – ACCE Action members and their allies frequently “take to the streets” with rallies, town halls, and other actions to make their voices heard.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blm-donate.com/posts/atlanta-solidarity-fund</guid><title>Atlanta Solidarity Fund</title><description>The Atlanta Solidarity Fund is a fund to support people in Atlanta who have been arrested for taking action against social injustice.</description><link>https://blm-donate.com/posts/atlanta-solidarity-fund</link><pubDate>Thu, 4 Jun 2020 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://actionnetwork.org/groups/atlanta-solidarity-fund">Atlanta Solidarity Fund</a></h1><h2><a href="https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-justiceforgeorgefloyd-protesters-in-atlanta">Donate Here</a></h2><p>The Atlanta Solidarity Fund is a fund to support people in Atlanta who have been arrested for taking action against social injustice.</p><p>Focused primarily on bailing out arrestees, with priority for those who have the most need.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blm-donate.com/posts/blm-houston</guid><title>BLM Houston</title><description>Black Lives Matter Houston is an organization that addresses the issues that affects Black folks and collaborates with partners to build a healthy, educated and financially stable Black community.</description><link>https://blm-donate.com/posts/blm-houston</link><pubDate>Thu, 4 Jun 2020 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://www.blmhouston.com/">BLM Houston</a></h1><h2><a href="https://www.paypal.me/blmhou">Donate Here</a></h2><p>Black Lives Matter Houston is an organization that addresses the issues that affects Black folks and collaborates with partners to build a healthy, educated and financially stable Black community.

Organizers who are among the original members of Black Lives Matter poured into the streets on July 13, 2013, the day that George Zimmerman was acquitted in the murder of Trayvon Martin. Thousands of folks initially gathered in Leimert Park and the Crenshaw District, then engaged in intuitive organizing, shutting down spaces that represented White supremacy, like the Expo train line, the 10 freeway, Hollywood &amp; Highland, and USC. Three days into the organic eruption, folks were called together by Patrisse Cullors, who had been in conversation with Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi about how to build a “movement not a moment.” On July 15, 2013, roughly 30 organizers gathered in the courtyard of St. Elmo’s Village, a historic Black artist community, and committed our lives to the Black freedom struggle, adopting a womanist/Black nationalist framework, with a queer and trans lens.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blm-donate.com/posts/chicago-ommunity-bond-fund</guid><title>The Chicago Community Bond Fund (CCBF)</title><description>The Chicago Community Bond Fund (CCBF) pays bond for people charged with crimes in Cook County, Illinois.</description><link>https://blm-donate.com/posts/chicago-ommunity-bond-fund</link><pubDate>Thu, 4 Jun 2020 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://chicagobond.org/">The Chicago Community Bond Fund (CCBF)</a></h1><h2><a href="https://chicagobond.org/donate/">Donate Here</a></h2><p>The Chicago Community Bond Fund (CCBF) pays bond for people charged with crimes in Cook County, Illinois. Through a revolving fund, CCBF supports individuals whose communities cannot afford to pay the bonds themselves and who have been impacted by structural violence. Inability to pay bond results in higher rates of conviction, longer sentences, loss of housing and jobs, separation of families, and lost custody of children. By paying bond, CCBF restores the presumption of innocence before trial and enables recipients to remain free while fighting their cases. CCBF also engages in public education about the role of bond in the criminal legal system and advocates for the abolition of money bond. CCBF is committed to long-term relationship building and organizing with people most directly impacted by criminalization and policing.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blm-donate.com/posts/cuapb-mn</guid><title>Communities United Against Police Brutality</title><description>Communities United Against Police Brutality is a Twin-Cities based organization that was created to deal with police brutality on an ongoing basis</description><link>https://blm-donate.com/posts/cuapb-mn</link><pubDate>Thu, 4 Jun 2020 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://www.cuapb.org/">Communities United Against Police Brutality</a></h1><h2><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=4XcNfQFUdyzy68NrQiMs-AoyZE7cOEw1f-K-5llu_I5NqMPkvTdk4g06M2vMisR7vTlNQ0&country.x=US&locale.x=US">Donate Here</a></h2><p>Communities United Against Police Brutality is a Twin-Cities based organization that was created to deal with police brutality on an ongoing basis.

A direct continuation of the grassroots efforts to close Rikers immediately, No New Jails NYC also draws on the success of previous of jail construction fights in NYC.</p><p>From May to November 2019, the Mayor’s jail expansion plan will be put before a string of public bodies and officials, each with increasing power, to say yea or nay to rezoning neighborhood locations in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx for the Mayor’s massive new jails via the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) process.</p><p>At the same time, No New Jails NYC is building power in communities throughout New York City and with its incarcerated members. Overwhelmingly, New Yorkers agree that all efforts should be dedicated now to closing all jails on Rikers Island, that there is no need to build any more jails, and that the billions of dollars budgeted for new jails should be redirected instead to community-based resources that will support permanent decarceration.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blm-donate.com/posts/reclaim-the-block-minneapolis</guid><title>Reclaim the Block</title><description>Reclaim the Block began in 2018 and organizes Minneapolis community and city council members to move money from the police department into other areas of the city’s budget that truly promote community health and safety.</description><link>https://blm-donate.com/posts/reclaim-the-block-minneapolis</link><pubDate>Thu, 4 Jun 2020 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://www.reclaimtheblock.org/">Reclaim the Block</a></h1><h2><a href="https://secure.everyaction.com/zae4prEeKESHBy0MKXTIcQ2">Donate Here</a></h2><p>Reclaim the Block began in 2018 and organizes Minneapolis community and city council members to move money from the police department into other areas of the city’s budget that truly promote community health and safety. We believe health, safety and resiliency exist without police of any kind. We organize around policies that strengthen community-led safety initiatives and reduce reliance on police departments. We do not believe that increased regulation of or public engagement with the police will lead to safer communities, as community testimony and documented police conduct suggest otherwise.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
