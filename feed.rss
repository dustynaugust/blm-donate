Thousands of folks initially gathered in Leimert Park and the Crenshaw District, then engaged in intuitive organizing, shutting down spaces that represented White supremacy, like the Expo train line, the 10 freeway, Hollywood &amp; Highland, and USC. Three days into the organic eruption, folks were called together by Patrisse Cullors, who had been in conversation with Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi about how to build a “movement not a moment.” On July 15, 2013, roughly 30 organizers gathered in the courtyard of St. Elmo’s Village, a historic Black artist community, and committed our lives to the Black freedom struggle, adopting a womanist/Black nationalist framework, with a queer and trans lens.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blm-donate.com/posts/blm-louisville</guid><title>Stand Up Sundays - Black Lives Matter Louisville</title><description>Stand Up Sundays is a community building coalition &amp; space to combat factors in opposition to BlackLivesMatter.</description><link>https://blm-donate.com/posts/blm-louisville</link><pubDate>Thu, 4 Jun 2020 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://blackliveslouisville.org/">Stand Up Sundays - Black Lives Matter Louisville</a></h1><h2><a href="https://blackliveslouisville.org/stand-up-sundays/donate/">Donate Here</a></h2><p>Stand Up Sundays is a community building coalition &amp; space to combat factors in opposition to #BlackLivesMatter.

We believe health, safety and resiliency exist without police of any kind. We organize around policies that strengthen community-led safety initiatives and reduce reliance on police departments. We do not believe that increased regulation of or public engagement with the police will lead to safer communities, as community testimony and documented police conduct suggest otherwise.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blm-donate.com/posts/richmond-community-bail-fund</guid><title>Richmond Community Bail Fund</title><description>A community bail fund that provides cash bail to defendants who cannot afford to pay it.

My dad, Chris "Fontayne" Herron, has put 10 years of sweat, blood, and tears into his shop and it so disappointing to know that his black-owned business was burned to the ground in spite of all that is happening in today's society. He has done nothing but give back to his community, for example running an annual toy run in Long Beach, CA (Popeye's Toy Run) every December for the past 12 years in remembrance of my grandpa, in which we give back to the people of our community by collecting donations of toys, bikes, gift cards, electronics, etc. He is also very active on Skid Row, working with Beauty 2 The Streetz where he volunteers and offers free haircuts to those in need on Skid Row. He watched his shop burn down right in front of him and could do nothing to make the fire stop fast enough. My dad is still in a state of shock and devastation and I know the help from people within our community and out would mean the world to him! It would mean so much to my dad and our family if those reading this could donate or simply just share this post so that he can try to rebuild all that was lost. Anything helps!!!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blm-donate.com/posts/tampa-bay-community-support-fund</guid><title>Tampa Bay Community Support Fund</title><description>The donations being used will provide community support for those who have had their civil liberties infringed upon by local law enforcement on 5/30 and 5/31 during peaceful Justice for George Floyd Event.</description><link>https://blm-donate.com/posts/tampa-bay-community-support-fund</link><pubDate>Thu, 4 Jun 2020 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/tampa-bay-community-support-fund">Tampa Bay Community Support Fund</a></h1><h2><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/tampa-bay-community-support-fund">Donate Here</a></h2><p>The donations being used will provide community support for those who have had their civil liberties infringed upon by local law enforcement on 5/30 and 5/31 during peaceful Justice for George Floyd Event.
