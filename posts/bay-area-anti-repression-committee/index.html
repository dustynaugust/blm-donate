We provide support for actions that are anti-patriarchal, anti-racist, anti-imperialist &amp; anti-capitalist. Our support work comes primarily in the form of education, information and referrals. We also manage an anti-repression bail fund for those that do not have the resources to bail or bond themselves. We are a first resort for education and information on solidarity and a last resort for financial support.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/filtered/oakland">Oakland</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/san-francisco">San Francisco</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/ca">CA</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/bail-fund">Bail Fund</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
