We believe health, safety and resiliency exist without police of any kind. We organize around policies that strengthen community-led safety initiatives and reduce reliance on police departments. We do not believe that increased regulation of or public engagement with the police will lead to safer communities, as community testimony and documented police conduct suggest otherwise.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/filtered/minneapolis">Minneapolis</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/mn">MN</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/organization">Organization</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/community">Community</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
