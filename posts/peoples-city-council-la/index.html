PCC emerged in the absence of definitive City action to protect the most vulnerable — the unhoused and tenants. The LA City Council repeatedly failed to enact protective measures, putting our neighbors at increasing risk during a time when they are worried about the health of their families and communities. We formed to call attention to the failures of Mayor Eric Garcetti and the Los Angeles City Council. At the same time, we have a mission to uplift the work being done every day, on the ground, by neighbors helping neighbors, organizing, and building community power — a Peoples’ City Council made up of communities fighting for an LA that is racially, economically, and environmentally just. We continue to evolve to meet the needs of our comrades. This dynamism is what makes us who we are.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/filtered/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/ca">CA</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/community">Community</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
