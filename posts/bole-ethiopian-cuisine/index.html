Our community is hurt and we are hurting with them.<br><br>As we silently watched our beloved Bolé went up in flames, it was heartbreaking to witness, what we all considered our home, reduced to ashes. What is positive? It is witnessing the overwhelming messages and well wishes that Solomon, Rekik, and the Bolé staff have received. And we thank you, on behalf of the entire family for standing with us when everything else seems like it has fallen beneath our feet. It is comforting to know that we are not alone in thinking that Bolé was not just a restaurant for us, Bolé was the pillar of the community. Bolé was our home away from home. Because your feedback to this unspeakable misfortune is to rise up, to rebuild, and to become the Bolé you all are accustomed to. And with your unyielding support, we are confident will have you dining at your clean tables in no time.</p><p>As you might have also known, the irreplaceable damage was not only caused to Bolé restaurant. Bolé Express, the fast food version of the Bolé franchise, due to open on Sunday, May 31st, 2020 was also burned to the ground. Solomon and the entire crew spent the last 8 months building Bolé Express and they are incredibly proud of the vision to offer an alternative to our busy customers by grabbing their meals with a 2-minute turn around service.</p><p>From the start, Bolé was a community driven business, this misfortune has taught all of us that community is what we all have when everything else is stripped away. Therefore, upon the overwhelming request by many of you, we have set up this platform so that you can donate for the initiation of the ‘Re-building Bolé’ project as you see fit.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/filtered/st-paul">St Paul</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/mn">MN</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/black-owned">Black Owned</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/small-business">Small Business</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
