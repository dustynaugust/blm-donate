My dad, Chris "Fontayne" Herron, has put 10 years of sweat, blood, and tears into his shop and it so disappointing to know that his black-owned business was burned to the ground in spite of all that is happening in today's society. He has done nothing but give back to his community, for example running an annual toy run in Long Beach, CA (Popeye's Toy Run) every December for the past 12 years in remembrance of my grandpa, in which we give back to the people of our community by collecting donations of toys, bikes, gift cards, electronics, etc. He is also very active on Skid Row, working with Beauty 2 The Streetz where he volunteers and offers free haircuts to those in need on Skid Row. He watched his shop burn down right in front of him and could do nothing to make the fire stop fast enough. My dad is still in a state of shock and devastation and I know the help from people within our community and out would mean the world to him! It would mean so much to my dad and our family if those reading this could donate or simply just share this post so that he can try to rebuild all that was lost. Anything helps!!!</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/filtered/long-beach">Long Beach</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/ca">CA</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/black-owned">Black Owned</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/small-business">Small Business</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
