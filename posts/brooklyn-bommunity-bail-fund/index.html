Thatâ€™s why BCBF is committed to challenging wealth-based detention in all forms and proud to serve as an incubator of high impact initiatives, often in partnership with other community-based organizations, that target legislative policy reform and systems change.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/filtered/brooklyn">Brooklyn</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/ny">NY</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/bail-fund">Bail Fund</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/bond-fund">Bond Fund</a></li><li><a href="/filtered/immigration">Immigration</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
